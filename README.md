# Self-Assessment

During the project, our team worked on Stocks predictions for three companies (Blackberry, Google and Netflix).
I played different roles for the different segments, and I handled the exploration data analysis phase using pandas Jupiter notebook. I scraped data directly from Yahoo Finance and cleaned the data by deleting null values from the data.
I merged the data and used charts to have an insight on the trend and performance of each Company stocks using the historical data.

I was also part of the Database phase by creating the ERD diagram with relationships for our Database table on PostgreSQL.

For the Dashboard visualization, we used JavaScript to create an interactive Data Visualization dashboard based on the Blackberry, Netflix, and Google Stocks. 
I was able to present both the historical and prediction chart also integrated the Tableau story board page. I also included the link to google chart on the navigation bar.
The Tableau and the historical charts are very interactive, with a click on the number of days, we can see the trend of each stock performance.
I am actually proud of my contibution towards the project, one of the task that really challenged me was been able to get the historical cahsrt to respond when the option of days button is cliscked. but I am glab I was able to do it.

# Team Assessment

Having spent 5 weeks with my team members, I have learnt a lot from each of them and we have been able to work together like we chose ourselves to be in the same group. Being able to work together seamlessly irrespective of our background, personality and methodology is incredible. This is evidence that being a great team player is a common skill that we share and its one of our major strengths.

One of the challenges I faced when we started was the inability to quickly agree on a particular task method, but over time we were able to overcome the challenge.
We all respect each others time and opinion and whenever we decide to meet virtually to work on our project, we are all present and participate to ensure the common goal is achieved. We mostly communicate using slack and Microsoft Teams.


# Summary of the Project
Using the historical data of three companies in the past five years to predict future stock prices. 
We used the LSTM model to predict future trend of the three stocks and the model predictions are very close to the actual trends for each stock in predicting future days stock prices.
We also observed there are other factors affecting the stock prices are High inflation rate, interest rates, unemployment rates and an increasing CPI. 

 The analysis can predict the volatility of each stock and make comparison to know the company with the highest investment returns. Our analysis will enable potential investors to make informed investment decision.
